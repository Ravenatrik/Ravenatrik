Hello, I’m Aratrik Basu, a 4th year Physics undergrad at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali. I am interested in astronomy and astrophysics, particularly in galaxy evolution and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). <br />
<br />
I am willing to explore scientific computing, and trying to learn Julia. Up until now, I have only coded in Python, and a tiny bit of C.
